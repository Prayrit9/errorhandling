# errorhandling
this code is about handling errors which occur during transactions
in this code there are three ways
# require
to validate user inputs and enforce preconditions for executing a function. Reverting due to a failed require will refund any remaining gas to the caller.
# assert
or internal consistency checks that should always be true. However, be cautious, as assert is more dangerous since it consumes all remaining gas and cannot be caught or handled.
# revert
or more specific and controlled error messages, especially in cases where you want to provide context for the error.
